# Changelog

All notable changes to pgEdge Vectorizer will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.1] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Tiktoken integration for accurate token counting
    - New `pgedge_vectorizer.use_tiktoken` GUC (default `off`) — set to `on` to use tiktoken via plpython3u
    - `tiktoken_count_tokens(text, encoding)` — counts tokens via tiktoken when enabled, falls back to approximation with a NOTICE on any error
    - `enable_tiktoken_support()` — creates the plpython3u helper after plpython3u/tiktoken are installed post-extension-load; returns `'ok'` on success or a descriptive error if tiktoken cannot be imported at runtime
    - `refresh_token_counts(chunk_table regclass)` — recomputes `token_count` for all rows in a chunk table using the current token-counting setting; useful for backfilling accurate counts after enabling `use_tiktoken = on`
- BM25 sparse vector support for hybrid (dense + sparse) search
- `hybrid_search()` function combining dense cosine similarity and BM25 sparse scoring via Reciprocal Rank Fusion

### Fixed

- `refresh_token_counts()` now correctly handles schema-qualified chunk tables via `REGCLASS` parameter

## [1.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- Support for any single-column primary key type in vectorized tables (#11)
    - Auto-detect PK column name and type from `pg_index` instead of hardcoding `BIGINT`
    - Chunk table `source_id` column now matches the source table's PK type (`UUID`, `TEXT`, `VARCHAR(n)`, etc.)
    - New `source_pk` parameter on `enable_vectorization()` for explicit column selection
    - Composite primary key tables supported by specifying `source_pk` explicitly

### Fixed

- Fixed stale embeddings and orphaned queue entries on content update (#12)
    - Queue entries are now cleaned up before deleting chunks in the vectorization trigger
    - Stale high-index chunks are cleaned up when re-enabling vectorization
    - Worker warns when a chunk is deleted by a concurrent source update
- Fixed queue processing not starting until SIGHUP after `CREATE EXTENSION` (#10)
    - Workers now use exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s, ... up to 5 min) when checking for extension installation, instead of a fixed 5-minute sleep
    - Extension is discovered within seconds of running `CREATE EXTENSION`, no SIGHUP needed
    - Improved log messages with actionable hints on first check failure

## [1.0-beta2] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- Hybrid chunking strategy (`hybrid`) inspired by Docling's approach
    - Parses markdown structure (headings, code blocks, lists, blockquotes, tables)
    - Preserves heading context hierarchy in each chunk for better RAG retrieval
    - Two-pass refinement: splits oversized chunks, merges undersized consecutive chunks with same context
    - Significantly improves retrieval accuracy for structured documents
- Markdown chunking strategy (`markdown`) - structure-aware without refinement passes
    - Simpler and faster alternative to hybrid
    - Good balance of structure awareness and performance
- Automatic fallback detection for `hybrid` and `markdown` strategies
    - Detects if content is likely markdown based on syntax patterns
    - Falls back to `token_based` chunking for plain text to avoid overhead
    - Ensures optimal strategy is always used regardless of content type

### Fixed

- Fixed potential buffer over-read vulnerabilities in markdown detection
- Fixed infinite recursion in markdown/hybrid fallback when content is plain text

## [1.0-beta1] - 2025-12-15

### Changed

- Promoted to beta status after extensive testing and bug fixes

### Fixed

- Fixed table name reference in vectorization code

## [1.0-alpha5] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed

- Fixed token-based chunking producing corrupted chunks when overlap > 0
    (chunks would start mid-word like "ntence." instead of proper word boundaries)
- Fixed potential negative index access in `find_good_break_point()` function

## [1.0-alpha4] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- Fixed uninitialized dimension variable in `generate_embedding()` that caused
    spurious "Dimension mismatch" errors with random dimension values

## [1.0-alpha3] - 2025-12-03

### Added

- Added a garbage collector to automatically delete old queue entries based on the
    age defined in the pgedge_vectorizer.auto_cleanup_hours GUC.
- `generate_embedding()` function for generating embeddings from query text directly in SQL

## [1.0-alpha2] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- PostgreSQL 18 support

### Changed

- Updated pgvector dependency to v0.8.1 for PostgreSQL 18 compatibility

## [1.0-alpha1] - 2025-11-21

### Added

- Initial release of pgEdge Vectorizer
- Automatic text chunking with configurable strategies (token_based, semantic, markdown)
- Background worker processing for asynchronous embedding generation
- Support for multiple embedding providers:
    - OpenAI (text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-3-large, text-embedding-ada-002)
    - Voyage AI (voyage-2, voyage-large-2, voyage-code-2)
    - Ollama (nomic-embed-text, mxbai-embed-large, all-minilm)
- Multi-column vectorization support
- Queue management with monitoring views (queue_status, failed_items, pending_count)
- Maintenance functions:
    - `enable_vectorization()` - Enable automatic vectorization for a table column
    - `disable_vectorization()` - Disable vectorization
    - `chunk_text()` - Manual text chunking
    - `retry_failed()` - Retry failed queue items
    - `clear_completed()` - Remove completed items from queue
    - `reprocess_chunks()` - Queue existing chunks for reprocessing
    - `recreate_chunks()` - Complete rebuild of chunks from source
    - `show_config()` - Display configuration settings
- Configurable chunking parameters (chunk_size, chunk_overlap)
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Batch processing for efficient API usage
- Non-ASCII character stripping option
- Comprehensive test suite with pg_regress
